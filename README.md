## Installation  
1. Unpack this archive.  
2. Run `AurieManager.exe` (Don't worry, it's safe. Or, you can search for it on Google and download it from the GitHub repo.)  
3. Set the game directory to where `Holocure.exe` is located.  
4. Click **"Install Aurie"**.  
5. Wait for it to finish, then add these mods one by one:  
   - `CallbackManagerMod.dll`  
   - `HoloCureCharacterCreatorMod.dll`  
   - `HoloCureMenuMod.dll`  

---

## Apply updates
1. Unpack `RushiaModSpritesAndConfig.rar`

3. Start game.


---

## Usage  
- Select Rushia in the character menu by pressing the right arrow.  
- Enjoy!  

---

## Known Issues  
- The game **crashes** when changing the language while playing a stage as Rushia. Please set the game language first before playing any stage.
- May have performance issues when playing as Rushia in-game.
- Opening a non-modded version of HoloCure may break this mod(?).

## Troubleshooting  
### 1. Can't find game / Game not starting / Can't add mods:  
- Open and close AurieManager. If it doesn't work, try deleting the config by opening **Aurie Manager** > **Settings** > **Delete Config** and try to start game as normal (via AuriaManager or HoloCure.exe).  

### 2. Can't select game / Missing executable file due to virus (non-verbatim) (Note: This error is exclusive for AurieManager, not the Character Mod and Character Config:  
- `AurieManager.exe` may have been falsely flagged as a virus by your antivirus (AV). Try turning off your AV temporarily, then run AurieManager. (Don't worry, it's 100% safe—I tested it myself.) After installation, turn your AV back on.  

### 3. Game crashes after entering the character selection screen:  
- This could be a config error. Ensure you have downloaded the mod properly. If not, try deleting the old mod folder and reinstalling it. Also, do the #1 solution.

### 4. Edited the Mod via in-game character editor and other issues:
- If you accidentally edit the mod via in-game character editor, 100% chance the mod config changed and the whole mod won't work anymore. Delete the whole mod folder and reinstall the mod again. Also, do the #1 solution.
