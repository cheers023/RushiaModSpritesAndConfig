## Installation  
1. Unpack this archive.  
2. Run `AurieManager.exe` (Don't worry, it's safe. Or, you can search for it on Google and download it from the GitHub repo.)  
3. Set the game directory to where `Holocure.exe` is located.  
4. Click **"Install Aurie"**.  
5. Wait for it to finish, then add these mods one by one:  
   - `CallbackManagerMod.dll`  
   - `HoloCureCharacterCreatorMod.dll`  
   - `HoloCureMenuMod.dll`

## Usage  
- Select Rushia in the character menu by pressing the right arrow.  
- Enjoy!

## Known Issues

- Opening a non-modded version of HoloCure may break this mod(?).

## Troubleshooting
1. Can't find game / Game not starting / Can't add mods:
   - Try to delete config by opening Aurie Manager > Settings > Delete Config.
3. Something about virus:
   - AurieManager may have been tagged as a false-positive by antivirus. Try to turn off it first them run it first. (Don't worry it's 100% safe. I tested it myself)
5. Game crashes after entering character selection screen:
   - It could be a config error. Make sure you have properly downloaded the mod. If not, try to delete the old mod folder and re-install it. Also, delete config (check #1) then open AurieManager.
